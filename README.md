# Employers salary web

Short description:
In the project there are three different roles: admin, project manager and employer. When Admin is singed-in, it is possible to see all employers information and set salaries for each one. Also admin can also remove employers. When employer is signed-in, he can see only his salary and set his personal information.

Project purpose and used technologies:
The purpose of the project is to show my programming skills. It is a small project, but I implemented broad spectrum of technologies. E.g., I have implemented Dependency injection principle. I have written unit tests for web api controller actions and business methods. For this goal I have used Moq package for mocking Entity framework. I have used Entity framework code first approach. As front end I have used razor views with jquery and Bootstrap css framework. I have also added error logger Elmah.

Final words:
This project is relatively small and does not show my full potencial, but it clearify what kind of programming I like the most and technologies which I would like to use.
